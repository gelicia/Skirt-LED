Code from http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/DirectDriveLEDMatrix

Font implemented taken from http://www.dafont.com/minecraftia.font

pngreader is a file written by @slembcke that takes a black and white PNG file and exports it as an array of 1s and 0s. It's not a 2D array.

Several of the tricksy algorithms were also written by @slembcke, who declined to putting them on his own github ;)
