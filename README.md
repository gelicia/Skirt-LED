pngreader is a file written by [slembcke](https://github.com/slembcke) that takes a black and white PNG file and exports it as an array of 1s and 0s. It's not a 2D array. Run it through the terminal pointing to a PNG like this: './pngreader < ~/Desktop/skirt2/pacman.png'

Several of the tricksy algorithms were also written by [slembcke](https://github.com/slembcke), who declined to putting them on his own github ;)
